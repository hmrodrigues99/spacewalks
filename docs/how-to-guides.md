## Add a custom file destination for the output CSV dataset generated by the Spacewalks software

So, you want to specify a destination for where your CSV dataset will be generated, uh?
Or perhaps you're just interested in a cool filename for it, hey?
Don't worry, just do the following:

```
python3 eva_data_analysis.py data/eva-data.json custom/path/custom_filename.csv
```

In custom/path, just specify the path where the file is generated.
In custom_filename, just replace it with a name you fancy.

Thank you mateys, see yeah again for more cool guides!
